# Example Dataset

We supply here an example dataset, a downsampled dataset of immune cells from patients with mild COVID-19, severe COVID-19, or healthy controls. To run the example, download and unzip the "TestCovidDataset.tar.gz" file, then configure the file `scripts/pipeline_runner.R` based on your preferences and system folder paths.

This dataset is from [COvid-19 Multi-omics Blood ATlas (COMBAT) Consortium, Cell 2022](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00070-8). Data was downloaded from the [cellxgene portal](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/8f126edf-5405-4731-8374-b5ce11f53e82) and downsampled to 2 patients per condition with ~800 cells each. (Note that the scDAPP paper uses the same samples but with all cells.)
